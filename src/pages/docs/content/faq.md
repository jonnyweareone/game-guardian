# FAQ (Parents & Schools)

**Q: Can my child disable the protections?**  
No. NextDNS is pinned; DNS changes are blocked by policy. Guardian services autoâ€‘repair tampering.

**Q: Do I need internet to log in?**  
No. Policies apply locally; sync resumes when online.

**Q: Can I bring apps from Pop!_Shop or COSMIC Store?**  
Yes. Guardian enforces policy across both. You can migrate later without losing protections.

**Q: How do I change my child's age profile?**  
From your Guardian dashboard; the device will sync changes automatically.

**Q: Is telemetry sent?**  
Only what you configure in your dashboard (device ID, policy state). No keystrokes or private content.
