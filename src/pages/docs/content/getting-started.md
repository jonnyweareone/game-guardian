# Getting Started with Guardian OS

Welcome to **Guardian OS** — a family‑safe operating system based on Pop!_OS and rebuilt for **safety, control, and simplicity**.

**Highlights**
- **Parent Admin + Child Account** during setup (child is primary, auto‑login).
- **Reflex Desktop**: safe UI with live filtering (blur/mute/flag).
- **Guardian Store**: curated apps with age ratings.
- **NextDNS Guardian**: network‑level protection, locked to Guardian.
- **Supabase Agent**: syncs policies, profiles, devices.

> *Safety First, Freedom Always.*
