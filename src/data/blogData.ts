    title: "We've Completely FNAF'ed Online Safety — Only Disney Can Save Our Kids Now",
    excerpt: "We block kids from watching horror games—but not from playing them. Here's why moderation ignores where kids actually are—and how Guardian OS fixes it.",

      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #666;">⸻</div>
      
      <p>We're scanning kids' faces to block them from YouTube.</p>
      
      <p>But not to stop them from playing:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>👻 PEGI 16+ horror survival games</li>
        <li>🎧 Unmoderated live voice chat with strangers</li>
        <li>🧨 Games packed with jump scares, violence, and drug use</li>
        <li>🎰 Community-made knockoffs like Piggy — darker, creepier, and child-targeted</li>
        <li>💬 And content that would absolutely be age-restricted if it appeared on Facebook or Instagram</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Yes — we've completely FNAF'ed online safety.</strong></p>
      
      <p>And at this point, only Disney can save our kids from the rabbit hole we've dug.</p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #666;">⸻</div>
      
      <h2>🎥 Moderation is Everywhere… Except Where Kids Actually Are</h2>
      
      <p>The big platforms — YouTube, Facebook, Twitch — have all grown up.</p>
      
      <p>They're the "old guard" now, trying desperately to prove they're safe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Face scans and age estimation</li>
        <li>13+ enforcement</li>
        <li>Strict content policies</li>
        <li>Automated moderation and AI flagging</li>
        <li>Creators being demonetised or banned for covering games like Five Nights at Freddy's</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>You could be blocked just for reviewing a game.</strong></p>
      
      <p>But if you're a 9-year-old?<br>
      You can play the game itself — with zero checks.</p>
      
      <p>No scan.<br>
      No gate.<br>
      No filter.<br>
      Just a username and a tap of a button.</p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #666;">⸻</div>
      
      <h2>🎮 Welcome to the Real Dark Web: In-Game Chat</h2>
      
      <p>In-game chat is completely unmoderated in most titles. It's the digital wild west:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time voice</li>
        <li>Anonymous players</li>
        <li>No age verification</li>
        <li>No scanning</li>
        <li>And zero context filtering</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>So while Facebook might remove a comment for "mildly inappropriate language," that same child could be listening to strangers scream profanities and make sexual threats through a headset — in real time — while navigating a PEGI 16 horror survival game.</p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #666;">⸻</div>
      
      <h2>🧒 The Age Trap: Where We Really Messed Up</h2>
      
      <p>We've created a paradox. A trap. And kids aged 8 to 13 are the ones caught in it.</p>
      
      <p><strong>They can't:</strong></p>
      
      <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
        <li>❌ Start a YouTube channel</li>
        <li>❌ Watch creators break down horror game lore</li>
        <li>❌ Post memes to Facebook or stream on Twitch</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>But they can:</strong></p>
      
      <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
        <li>✅ Play the horror game itself</li>
        <li>✅ Chat with strangers</li>
        <li>✅ Get exposed to bullying, grooming, and adult content</li>
        <li>✅ Get lost in Piggy, Doors, or Backrooms-style knockoffs with no filters whatsoever</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>By clamping down on the safe, moderated platforms, we've driven kids into the unmoderated ones. They still want to play, connect, and create — but we've left them with only the most dangerous options.</p>
      
      <p><strong>That's how the rabbit hole becomes the Mad Hatter.</strong></p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #666;">⸻</div>
      
      <h2>🤡 The PEGI Illusion</h2>
      
      <p>PEGI ratings were never meant to be security systems — they're just labels.</p>
      
      <p>They weren't designed for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always-on cloud gaming</li>
        <li>Free-to-play horror knockoffs</li>
        <li>User-generated content in game engines</li>
        <li>Children bypassing parents with a tap and swipe</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>And yet platforms still act like PEGI is doing the work.<br>
      It's not. If anything, it's a sticker on a leaky dam.</p>
      
      <p>Unless parents set up elaborate profile restrictions (and even then…), nothing stops a 9-year-old from launching a PEGI 16+ game on Xbox Cloud, Steam, or Roblox.</p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #666;">⸻</div>
      
      <h2>🛡️ This Is Why We Built Guardian OS</h2>
      
      <p>Guardian OS doesn't just suggest controls — it enforces them. Automatically.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Facial scan login</strong> — we know which child is in front of the screen</li>
        <li>🎮 <strong>PEGI filtering + deep link control</strong> — only age-appropriate games appear</li>
        <li>🔐 <strong>Kiosk mode</strong> — for younger kids, with no access to risky games or apps</li>
        <li>🧼 <strong>DNS-level content filters</strong> — switchable in real time per child</li>
        <li>📊 <strong>Parental dashboard</strong> — no surveillance, no cloud data, total control</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>It's local-first, secure, and private by design.<br>
      If a 6-year-old replaces a 14-year-old at the PC, Guardian OS notices — and instantly locks down anything that's not appropriate.</p>
      
      <p><strong>We're not blocking creativity. We're stopping accidental exposure to harm.</strong></p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #666;">⸻</div>
      
      <h2>🧵 Final Thought: The Safety Mismatch</h2>
      
      <p>We're blocking kids from watching horror games on YouTube.<br>
      But we're doing nothing to stop them from playing even more extreme games with live strangers and zero oversight.</p>
      
      <p>If we trust Disney to make safe content for kids…<br>
      We should at least ask why we don't apply the same level of care to the platforms kids are actually using.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Online safety isn't about blocking content. It's about controlling the experience.</strong><br>
      Guardian OS is how we fix this — before the rabbit hole gets deeper.</p>
