      <p>Gaming offers numerous psychological benefits for children and adolescents, including problem-solving skill development, social connection, and stress relief. However, like any activity, gaming requires thoughtful boundaries to ensure it remains a positive influence.</p>
      
      <h2>The Importance of Balance</h2>
      <p>Healthy gaming habits aren't about elimination—they're about integration. Research shows that moderate gaming can improve cognitive function, social skills, and emotional regulation when balanced with other activities.</p>
      
      <h3>Signs of Healthy Gaming</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gaming is enjoyed alongside other hobbies and interests</li>
        <li>Children can stop playing when asked without extreme distress</li>
        <li>Gaming doesn't interfere with sleep, school, or family time</li>
        <li>Players maintain real-world friendships and relationships</li>
        <li>Gaming is used as one of several coping strategies for stress</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Age-Appropriate Gaming Guidelines</h2>
      <p>Different developmental stages require different approaches to gaming boundaries:</p>
