# Guardian AI Platform

This is the Guardian AI platform for device management, child safety monitoring, and digital parenting tools.

## Two-Phase Device Registration Flow

The Guardian AI platform supports a streamlined device registration flow:

### Phase 1: Device Self-Registration
Devices register themselves and poll for activation without parent involvement:

```bash
# Register device
curl -X POST "https://xzxjwuzwltoapifcyzww.supabase.co/functions/v1/device-registration" \
  -H "x-device-id: GG-XXXX-XXXX" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Poll for activation
while true; do
  response=$(curl -s "https://xzxjwuzwltoapifcyzww.supabase.co/functions/v1/device-status?device_id=GG-XXXX-XXXX")
  activated=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.activated // false')
  
  if [ "$activated" = "true" ]; then
    device_jwt=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.device_jwt')
    echo "Device activated! JWT: ${device_jwt:0:20}..."
    break
  fi
  
  echo "Waiting for parent activation..."
  sleep 5
done
```

### Phase 2: Parent Activation
Parents visit `/activate?device_id=GG-XXXX-XXXX` to bind device and assign child.
