## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Portsmouth, UK – 9 September 2025** – Guardian AI Limited today announced the upcoming launch of **Guardian OS**, the first operating system in the world designed from the ground up to protect children online. More than just a filter or an app, Guardian OS is *safe by design* — combining built-in protection with a platform for children to **play, learn, and explore** the digital world with confidence.

Launching officially on **12 September 2025**, Guardian OS is based on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**, one of the world's most trusted and secure open-source systems, enhanced with **AI-powered parental controls**. This unique combination makes Guardian OS the first complete computing environment designed around the needs of families in a digital age.

> "The internet wasn't created with children in mind. Parents are forced to choose between over-restricting their kids or letting them roam unsafe spaces," said **Jonny Robinson**, founder of Guardian AI Limited. "**Guardian OS changes that.** It's a foundation built for children to play, learn, and explore safely — with parents in control, but without having to hover."

## The First of Its Kind

Guardian OS is more than an operating system — it's a **complete family environment**. Children can enjoy games, creative apps, and educational tools, while parents have peace of mind that protection is working in the background.

**Key features include:**
- ✅ **Safe by Design** – protection isn't optional; it's built into the system itself.
- 🤖 **AI Reflex Protection** – real-time AI that blurs unsafe images, mutes toxic voice chats, and blocks grooming attempts instantly.
- 🌐 **Built-In Safe Browsing** – Guardian DNS and NextDNS block harmful sites automatically.
- 🎮 **Family-Friendly App Store** – every app comes with age ratings, warnings, and parent approval prompts.
- ☁️ **Parental Dashboard** – manage devices, screen time, and app approvals from anywhere.
- 📊 **Activity Insights** – clear reports on learning, gaming, and browsing habits.
- 👤 **Portable Profiles** – children's safety settings follow them to any Guardian OS device.
- 🔐 **Trusted Security** – built on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, with encryption and secure device management.

## Play, Learn, Explore

Guardian OS is designed not to limit children, but to **empower them**. Kids can access safe games, explore age-appropriate websites, and use creative and educational apps without stumbling into harm. Parents gain visibility, guidance, and reassurance — while children keep their independence.

## Free to Start – With Affordable Premium Options

Guardian OS is **free for personal and educational use**. Core protections, including grooming detection, are always included. Families also receive a **30-day free trial** of Guardian Reflex and Advanced Protection.

**Premium pricing:** **£8.99/month** (single-child) and **£14.99/month** (family).  
Guardian AI Limited is also preparing a **bundle tier with cloud gaming platforms**, expected to launch in **Q1 2026**.

## What's Next: Nova Virtual Assistant

Guardian AI Limited already has its next update in the works: **Nova**, a child-friendly **virtual assistant** built directly into Guardian OS. Nova will help children with homework, guide them through safe online activities, and support parents by reinforcing healthy digital habits. Nova is planned as the first major feature update after launch, extending Guardian OS from a protective platform to a supportive one.
